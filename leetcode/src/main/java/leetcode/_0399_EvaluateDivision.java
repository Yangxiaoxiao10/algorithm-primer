 *
 * <pre>
 * Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0.
 * queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? .
 * return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
 *
 * The input is: vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> queries , where equations.size() == values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the equations. Return vector<double>.
 *
 * According to the example above:
 *
 * equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
 * values = [2.0, 3.0],
 * queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ].
 *
 * The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
